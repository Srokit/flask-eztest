# Thanks for taking interest in contributing to flask-eztest

## Remarks

This is my first open source project that I am seriously undertaking. Go easy one me pls :)

## Goals

To make an easy to use / intuitive interface for creating automated UI tests for Flask applications

One of the main ways this tool will make testing easy is by injecting identifiers into the html templates
of the app that reflect the current schema of the webapps sql database

Overall I believe the selenium webdriver's tools can be combined with python unittest assert statements to
make a dead simple abstraction for testing UI elements using identifiers that are generated from the database model
