# Thanks for taking interest in contributing to flask-eztest

## Remarks

This is my first open source project that I am seriously undertaking. Go easy one me pls :)

## Goal

To make an easy to use / intuitive interface for creating automated UI tests for Flask applications

## Ideas going forward

- Add support for command line args that can specify exactly which suite to run or maybe even picking out a
specific test case to run

- Add in watcher support so that a developer can tie a suite to a module or collection of modules in their
flask app that are responsible for rendering pages tested by that suite and then have the suite run when
changes are detected in those modules.

## How to contribute

I accept any pull requests or issues into consideration on GitHub
